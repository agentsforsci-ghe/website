I have reviewed the lesson plan and slides of agentsforsci-ghe/website branch (feat/day-combined) uo until lunch. here is my feedback:



<pasted_content id="26e8">


- is there an opportunity to highlight the difference between a DOCX, PDF, md and qmd file? The facts that some are closed and open, the fact that some can be generated from another, the efficiency costs of PDF over md? Could I somewheat give people an "aha" effect by looking into the source code of a DOCX and XLSX, vs MD and CSV? E.g. people could type a csv?

- i like the recall, but somewhere is still need to include that this whole workflow isn't always the same for all tasks. I had a slide on that in the early version, it's from wickham workshop

- why does in the framed run at 10:47, question 2 and 3 are used for the studio cards?

- the open-pr skill never pushes, I think that needs to change. It can push, but must tell the learner that it has pushed and how many commits were part of that push.  

- I am still unsure about the recall, especially the way it is introduce on slide 10. it's out of context there. 

- slide 17: use my workflow graph from the 17:15 talk

- slide 19: the my turn. do I paste the PDF into the chat and then get a result as the dome? What should the question be? The one from my question bank?

- the "Where the instructions live" box is okay, but that's obvious "the chat box". What's more relevant is: where do the results live? Or how where the results generated? 

- On slide 21: what's "find the mode line" and what's the point ehre?

- A switch to auto mode is important. I need to ensure that everyone operates in automode. The shift-tab is something I need to do, show, and have people also follow. I need also give the tip to hit escpace and use the arrow keys on keyboard. Also: A screenshot can always be dropped into the box. 

- lesson plan: what's in the arrival slot? What'0s the evidence wall? how do I prepare the question sheets? what's the last ppint about: to sticker on arrival...

- unsure if I want to paif phone on slide 24 or when it actually matters.

- slide 22. "do all commits yourself". Does something get written ourselves? Then, yes. Maybe start a small file inside the project, and .md file and write something. Commit that. 

- your turn: the framed run: what's log the run on the day sheet?

- model, harness, tool call come at a strange spot. I don't know why they are here of what a novice learner should take away from it. I want to highlight what pasting to claude.ai does, where things are stored, how you would be able to continue working with it, how you could collaborate on the code? The answer is largely nowhere useful for collabroation or reproducibility. 

- your turn: the studio: what does m"log it" mean? as above? what's the day sheet?

- slide 41. Use the screenshot of the declaration standard as used for my talk at DSN. Briefly introduce that this is the taxonomy that came out as a suggetion for declaring use of AI. You would tick a box.

- of our turn at slide 38: switch to main and pull is useful. shows that the merge went through and that main and dev are equal now. Whey render manuscript after? I want to render from RStudio and create before the relase. That gives a little bit of Quarto practice. 

- then Claude can be used for the rest. the tag, the release, attaching the DOCX to the release. Say / Show that this could be the DOCX shared by email or uploaded to a Cloud drive for review and collaboration. Somewhere in the second release, I also want to introduce running through the quarto file and leaving TODO markers. It's the human review that leaves TODO comments. Then we tell Claude to work through the TODOs to improve the manuscript.
